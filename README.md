# What the Factory üè≠

#### _Basic many-to-many database relation in .NET Core MVC_ | Patrick Lee

## Description

This project was made to demonstrate usage of many-to-many relationships while working with MySQL databases in C# with the .NET Core MVC framework. The solution allows a business owner, one "Dr. Sillystringz," to add, view, edit, and delete both employees (Engineers) and the equipment they are licensed to repair (Machines), in a many-Engineers-to-many-Machines relationship.

## Setup and Use

### Prerequisites

- [.NET 5 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0)
- A text editor like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- A command line interface like Terminal or GitBash to set up and run the project
- MySQL 8.0.19, following [these pinned installation instructions](https://web.archive.org/web/20210521163651/https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/c-and-net/getting-started-with-c/installing-and-configuring-mysql)
- A web browser to view and interact with the project

### Installation

1. Clone the repository: `$ git clone https://github.com/patrick-verbs/WhatTheFactory.Solution`
2. Navigate to the `WhatTheFactory.Solution` directory on your computer
3. Open with your preferred text editor to view the code base
4. To setup the SQL database using MySQL:
   - Create an `appsettings.json` file in the `Factory` directory
   - Copy the text box below and paste into the `appsettings.json` file, replacing `<password>` with your MySQL password:
   ```
     {
        "ConnectionStrings": {
           "DefaultConnection": "Server=localhost;Port=3306;database=patrick_lee;uid=root;pwd=<password>;"
         }
     }
   ```
   - Open your terminal and run the command: `mysql -uroot -p<mysql_password>` (replace `<mysql_password>` with your MySQL password) to launch MySQL server
5. To serve the local web app:
   - Navigate to `WhatTheFactory.Solution/Factory` in your command line
   - Run the following commands:
     - `dotnet restore` to restore the dependencies that are listed in `Factory.csproj`
     - `dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore -v 5.0.0`
     - `dotnet add package Pomelo.EntityFrameworkCore.MySql -v 5.0.0-alpha.2`
     - `dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Proxies -v 5.0.0`
     - `dotnet build` to build the project and its dependencies into a set of binaries
     - `dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef` to install EF Core tools
     - `dotnet ef database update` to build the MySQL database
   - Finally, run the command `dotnet run` to run the project!
   - Note: `dotnet run` also restores and builds the project, so you can use this single command to start the app
6. Visit the application via web browser at: `localhost:5000/`
